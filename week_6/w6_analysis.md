## option 1 - weather data in 6k cities across India from 2010 - 2024

1. What question are you trying to answer? I am curious about the temperature trends between urban and rural areas in India, considering their high population density and the increase in infrastructure.

2. Why is this question worth answering? This can be either because it has some personal value to you or because it is a question that others are asking. If it is a question others are asking, then provide an example.
   We can compare and analyze if certain city planning has had a positive or negative impact on weather conditions. This will be useful for mitigating possible negative effects from urban infrastructure and planning.

3. What is your hypothesis? Why leads you towards that hypothesis? Usually major metro areas exhibit higher temperature trends compared to surrounding rural areas due to less vegetation (urban heat island)

   This would be important to showcase player satisfaction levels across game types, and what could cause player sentiment to decline.

3. What is your hypothesis? Why leads you towards that hypothesis? From my own gaming experience, Story driven games lead to higher investment, and more community involvement. I would expect those games with multiple releases to have most positive reviews. I think certain multiplayer games could have more negative reviews due to issues with player interactions. Also, games with frequent updates will likely have positive reviews, whereas games with poor support or controversial updates may experience the highest variance in reviews.
